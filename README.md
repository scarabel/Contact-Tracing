Codes for the renewal equation model of contact tracing

The codes in this repository are used to reproduce the figures in the paper:
Scarabel F, Pellis L, Ogden NH, Wu J. A renewal equation model to assess roles and limitations of contact tracing for disease outbreak control. Royal Society Open Science, 2021.

The following files are available:
- 'Fig2_controllability.m': script to reproduce Fig 2;
- 'Fig3_Fig4_tracing_window.m': script to reproduce Fig 3 and Fig 4;
- 'Fig5_constraints.m': script to reproduce Fig 5;
- 'Fig6_R0_ec.m': script to reproduce Fig 6;
- 'FigSM2_delay_diagnosis.m': script to reproduce Supplementary Material, Fig 2;
- 'linear_contact_tracing.m': function to solve the linearized equation;
- 'Figures': folder containing the figures included in the article.

The codes are tested on MATLAB R2020b.
