# Contact-Tracing
Codes for the renewal equation model of contact tracing

The codes in this repository are used to reproduce the figures in the paper
Scarabel F, Pellis L, Ogden NH, Wu J. A renewal equation model to assess roles and limitations of contact tracing for disease outbreak control. Royal Society Open Science, 2021.

The following codes are available:
- Fig 2: see script 'Fig2_controllability.m'
- Fig 3 and Fig 4: see script 'Fig3_Fig4_tracing_window.m'
- Fig 5: see script 'Fig5_constraints.m'
- Fig 6: see script 'Fig6_R0_ec.m'
- Suppl Material, Fig 2: see script 'FigSM2_delay_diagnosis.m'

The codes are tested on MATLAB R2020b.
